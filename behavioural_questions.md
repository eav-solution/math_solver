1. What attracted you to our startup?
 - Vision.
 - Mission.
 - Challenge.
 - Money.

2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?
 A normal people (with whatever role) who explore idea, leverage technology, sharing knowledge to help others.

3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)? 
 Same as question 1 and adding NOT before every linebreak.

4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why?
 I think humans have reached a biological limitation: we can only "learn" for several decades in our lifetime. Technology will help us overcome this limitation.

 For example, if we want to learn how to optimize processors, we first need to understand what a processor is and how to build one. There is a huge and ever-growing amount of knowledge to absorb. We need a “supporter” who never complains about our basic questions. This isn’t just a tool—it’s a co-worker and a friend, someone who will collaborate with every human in the future.

5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?
    Good traits:
        - Curious: I am curious not only about technology, but also about anything new to me. I seek out new information every day and apply it to my tasks directly and instantly.
        - Passionate: For me, technology is not just a job—it's a game, and I enjoy it every day, especially when our work is meaningful to others.
        - Friendly: I can communicate with new people and quickly become familiar with them. I also tend to be silent, think, and analyze when there are differing ideas, and I provide feedback when needed.
    Bad traits:
        - Tech focus: Focusing too much on technology leaves me with little time for personal work or other aspects, such as marketing, networking, or developing business skills.
        - Self-handling: Self-handling: It might have been a good trait right after I graduated, but it’s a major drawback now. We need to delegate tasks to others at the right time and to the right people.
        - Concerned about the meaning of my work: I do a lot with technology/AI/devices, but the big question is whether we actually need them or if we are creating redundant things. That is the reason why I have changed companies so often.

6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?
 - Think about your job, your family in next 50 years.

7. What do you believe is true, but can’t prove?
 - The meaning of the life is no meaning, every people will "choose" the meaning of the life.

Whatever the result, it's a good chance to explore and review myself with your question. Thanks!
